						<h3>Pi - top</h3>
						<p>Pi -top is the small tablet/ computer, based on raspberry pi microcontroller, seven inch LCD touchscreen display and covering printed on 3D printer assembled together.The operation system is Linux Debian, because it's the most stable OS for ARM devices (like raspberrypi, orangepi, bananapi) This computer was created for children who just start understanding the computervs and computer systems, but also is can be used by other people, students, workers, etc</p>

						<h3>Bionic Hand</h3>
						<p>Bionics or biologically inspired engineering is the application of biological methods and systems found in nature to the 
							study and design of engineering systems and modern technology That the bionic arm consits of the servos and works on the arduino programming board, 
							that it was 3D printed and the sketch is an open source of the InMoov robot part. InMoov is a humanoid robot, constructed out of 3D printable plastic body components, 
							and controlled by Arduino microcontrollers

						<h3>Solar Tracker</h3>
						<p>A solar tracker is a device that orients a payload toward the Sun. Payloads are usually solar panels, parabolic troughs, fresnel reflectors, lenses or the mirrors of a heliostat.
							In concentrator photovoltaics (CPV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) applications, trackers are used to enable the optical components in the CPV and CSP systems.
							 The optics in concentrated solar applications accept the direct component of sunlight light and therefore must be oriented appropriately to collect energy. 
							 Tracking systems are found in all concentrator applications because such systems collect the sun's energy with maximum efficiency when the optical axis is aligned with incident solar radiation.

						<h3>Passive House</h3>
						<p>Passive house is rigorous, voluntary standard for energy efficiency in a builiding, 
							which reduces the buildingâ€™s ecological footprint that require little energy for space heating or cooling. 
							Passive house is the smart system to control the temperature in the house. The main thing is it uses alternative energy. It is fully automated and the thing you just have to set the temperature .
							 According the temperature of the air in the house it manages the heating system. The system works even when the user is away from home
